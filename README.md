# Dangerous Dungeon.
This is another one my C++ lessons project. Here i try to create simple RPG console based game.  
Using only STL. Trying to improve my C++ skils.  

Here some functionalties  

## Game
Use "WASD" to control player(letter 'P' on console). 
Change global var "FPS" in code - to speed|slow game  
The main idea of game is endless dungeon grind. Enter any possible door and try your best in fights with monsters. 
I will add magic attacks, shops, player inventory and basic player stats and abilities soon.  

## Updates
UPD v1.0.0  
* Added room creation class and functions.
* Added player. Player movement mechanics.
* Added enemy.
* Added simple fight mechanics.
* Added simple levelup mechanincs.
