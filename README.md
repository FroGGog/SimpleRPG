# Dangerous Dungeon.
This is another one my C++ lessons project. Here i try to create simple RPG console based game.  
Using only STL. Trying to improve my C++ skils.  

Here some functionalties  

## Game
Use "WASD" to control player(letter 'P' on screen). 
Change global var "FPS" in code - to speed|slow game.  

The main idea of game is endless dungeon grind.Clear room to generate new one. Level up. Get better weapons and armors. Try your best.  
I will add magic attacks, shops, player inventory and basic player stats and abilities soon. All game settings will be in additional .txt file.
